This defines a bookmarklet that allows you to copy and paste the goals from a Trello card description and they will automatically be added to the experiment you are viewing.

Info is logged to the console regarding errors, etc.


### TODO:

- Add a alert output for goals not being added because they are already present
- Remove the comma at the end of each goal in alert output. Just do one per line.
- Replace out `(primary)` from the goal strings
