Card Info Snippet
=====

This is a bookmarklet that will attempt to generate a fancy `experiment.json` file for you based on info it finds in an experiment trello card.
The snippet should be run when viewing the experiment card.

It opens a prompt window containing the json code that can then be copied to experiment.json.

The output currently looks something like this:
```
{
  "description": "WIN-22: Landing Win On All The Page",
  "edit_url": "http://www.website.com/place-for-awesome/wow/",
  "trello_card": "https://trello.com/c/GbzoN8u6/1760-win-22-landing-win-on-all-the-page",
  "hypothesis": "With the new design of the awesome, conversion for winning and form filling will be better on the winning than on the junk pages.",
  "target_urls": [
    "www.website.com/place-for-awesome/wow/",
    "www.website.com/place-for-awesome/this/",
    "www.website.com/place-for-awesome/is/",
    "https://website.com/place-for-awesome/crazy/"
  ],
  "variations": [
    "Original: (no change)",
    "Var 1: They don't think it be like it is, but it do"
  ],
  "audience_targeting": [
    "Everyone"
  ],
  "goals": [
    "Fancy get all the things (primary)",
    "Learn all of the data infos",
    "Get all of the monies",
    "Engagement"
  ],
  "dev_notes": "Utilize magic, and produce the delicious eye sugar."
}
```

Future Plans
------
My plan is that we can start a new experiment using this json file as a blueprint. 
I'd like to add a function to crowrap that will initialize an experiment directory using this file.
